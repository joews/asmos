My First OSâ„¢

A bootload-only x86 assembler operating system from the [MikeOS tutorial](http://mikeos.berlios.de/write-your-own-os.html).

For now it does one thing - boots from hard disk (or a floppy disk image) and displays a greeting!

## Setup

For OSX Mavericks:

    brew install qemu
    export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qemu/<version>/bin:$PATH
